# This is a test for 2-matrix.py
# It divides a matrix by a value and stores it in a list

```python
>>> div = __import__("2-matrix_divided").matrix_divided

>>> my_1_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

>>> my_2_list = [[1, 2, 3], 7]

>>> my_3_list = [[1, 'b', 3], [4, 5, 6]]

>>> my_4_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7]]

>>> my_5_list = [[1.66, 2.67, 3.4], [4, 5, 6]]

>>> div(my_1_list, 3)
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]
>>> div(my_5_list, 3)
[[0.55, 0.89, 1.13], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]
