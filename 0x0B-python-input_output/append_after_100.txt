At Holberton School,
Python is really important,
"C is fun!"
"C is fun!"
"C is fun!"
"C is fun!"
"C is fun!"
"C is fun!"
"C is fun!"
But it can be very hard if:
- You don't get all Pythonic tricks
"C is fun!"
"C is fun!"
"C is fun!"
"C is fun!"
"C is fun!"
"C is fun!"
"C is fun!"
- You dn't have strong C knowledge.
i love Python
"C is fun!"
